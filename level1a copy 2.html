		Process is more important than outcome. When the outcome drives <br>

		process drives outcome we may not know where we are going, but <br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		we will know we want to be there.

		<del>Forget about good.</del> Good is a known quantity. Good is what we all agree on.<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		Growth is not necessarily good. Growth is an exploration of unlit recesses<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		that may or may not yield to our research. As long as you stick to good you <br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
		will never have real growth.

		<br>1.<br>
		Allow events to change you. You have to be willing to grow. Growth is different from <br>
		something that happens to you. You produce it. You live it. The prerequisites for gro-<br>wth:
		the openness to experience events and the willingness to be changed by them.
