We have been beavering away all year to meet a consistent and growing demand for beautiful Bindles. With your Blessing it is now time for a BREATHER as we don’t want to burn out.
<br><br>
We will still be hanging around, but please be aware that your orders may take up to five days instead of “yesterday”, so turn your expectations to flight mode just for now. We will return to Superman status again on 7th January – “faster than a speeding bullet. More powerful than a locomotive…”.

<br><br>

To everyone involved with Bindle this year, THANK YOU. You are amazing!</div>
