            A live score with Stuart Argabright.
            <br><br>
            On May 3, composer Stuart Argabright will return to his score for Bender’s landmark work <span class="body-ital">Total Recall</span> (1987), accompanying the work of electronic theater with an added intro, outro, and expanded composition, intimately staged within the installation of Bender’s proscenium of screens. A one-night only event to experience <span class="body-ital">Total Recall</span> revisited, Argabright pulls from his archive of cassette tapes originally used in 1987 to construct the work’s expansive soundscape, which includes audio samples from car, soda, and early computer commercials, as well as the videos appropriated by Bender herself, such as Oliver Stone’s movie <span class="body-ital">Salvador</span> (1986) and commercials for the US Army Reserve.

            Two live audio-visual performances featuring Stuart Argabright and Black Rain, Philip Vanderhyden, and Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith. Co-presented with ISSUE Project Room.
            <br><br>
            Held on Saturday, May 18, the two live audio-visual performances have been organized in response to Bender’s unfinished work of media theater, which was to be entitled So Much Deathless. In writing on Bender’s earlier <span class="body-ital">Total Recall</span> (1987), the critic Jonathan Crary compared her electrifying performance to the narcotic “image haze” of 80s television, stating that Bender “outlines survival tactics for artists to maintain a mobile position at the boundaries of mass culture.” These performances follow in Bender’s footsteps, and continue to sketch survival tactics for our evolving media and cultural landscape.
