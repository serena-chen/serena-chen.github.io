          The <em>Tor</em> software system has built a reputation as the “dark internet” - an ungoverned and seemingly ungovernable space where web users can surf with complete anonymity.

          <br><br>
          Short for The Onion Router, it works by sending web traffic over a series of nodes - or onion routes - adding layers of encryption coding at various stages resulting in online users and browsers, along with the people hosting the websites it features, being untraceable by the authorities.

          <br><br>
          “Ten years ago, no one had this concept of privacy. But with the [former General David] Petraeus scandal and cellphones recording your location, now this doesn’t seem so far-fetched any more.”

          <br><br>
          15,000 Brits now thought to be using Tor every day, around 5,000 are believed to be doing so for criminal reasons.

          <br><br>
          People who have increasing concerns over how their personal information is used were turning to proxy sites like Tor.

          <br><br>
          “whatever online environment is out there, there will be people who will use it for their own reasons”, she warned potential users: “Even the most technically sound person will make mistakes and leave footprints.”

          What was the most damaging data breach in the last 12 months?
          The trick answer is: it's likely something we don't even know about.

          <br><br>
          State surveillance is driven by fear. And corporate surveillance is driven by money.

          <br><br>
          Those who control the data gain enormous power over those who don't. The power is not overt, but implicit in the algorithms they write, the queries they run, and the kind of world they feel entitled to build.

          <br><br>
          In this world, privacy becomes a luxury good.

          <br><br>
          The ad networks' name for this robotic deception is 'ad fraud' or 'click fraud'. (Advertisers like to use moralizing language when their money starts to flow in the wrong direction. Tricking people into watching ads is good; being tricked into showing ads to automated traffic is evil.)
