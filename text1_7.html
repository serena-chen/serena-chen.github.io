              I was very taken with Bastian Allgeier's talk yesterday on decentralization. And we'll be discussing a lot of these issues at Decentralize Camp tomorrow.

              <br><br>
              Folklore has it that the Internet was designed to survive a <span class="rollover bg61">nuclear war</span>. 

              <br><br>
              A good guiding principle is that no one company, or one country, should have the ability to damage the Internet, even if it begins to act maliciously. Some kinds of services are just crying out for decentralization. Fifty years from now, people will be shocked that we had <span class="rollover bg62">one social network</span> that all seven billion people on the planet were expected to join. 

              <br><br>
              Imagine if there was only one bar in Düsseldorf, or all of Germany, and if you wanted to hang out with your friends, you had to go there. And when you did, there were <span class="rollover bg63">cameras everywhere</span>, and microphones, and you were constantly being interrupted by people <span class="rollover bg64">selling you stuff</span>. That's the situation that obtains with Facebook today. 

              <br><br>
              Surveillance as a
              <a class="rollover bg65" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/02/facebook-executive-advertising-data-comment">business model</a> is the only thing that makes a site like Facebook possible.
