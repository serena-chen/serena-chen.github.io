              I have always wanted to have a <span class="rollover bg66">'Death to America!'</span> slide. Maybe I should just say 'de-americanize'.

              <br><br>
              As a naturalized US citizen, whose citizenship can potentially be revoked by court order, let me just say America is the greatest country on Earth, and I am lucky to live there. I am sorry that you can't live there too.

              <br><br>
              This <span class="rollover bg67">festive map</span> shows seismic hazard in Northern California, where pretty much all the large Internet companies are based, along with a zillion startups.

              <br><br>
              Now of course, each company has four zillion datacenters, backed up across the world. But how much will that matter when there's a major quake, and <span class="rollover bg68">Silicon Valley</span> can't get to work for a month? All of these headquarters are going to be shut down for a long time when the Big One comes. You're going to notice it.

              <br><br>
              So even if you don't agree with my politics, maybe you'll agree with my geology. Let's not build a vast, distributed global network only to put everything in one place!

              <br><br>
              I'm tired of being scared of what the web is going to look like tomorrow.

              <br><br>
              One of the worst aspects of surveillance is how it limits our ability to be creative with technology. It's like a tax we all have to pay on innovation. We can't have cool things, because they're too potentially invasive.

              <br><br>
              Imagine if we didn't have to worry about privacy, if we had strong guarantees that our inventions wouldn't immediately be used <span class="rollover bg69">against us</span>. Robin gave us a glimpse into that world, and it's a glimpse into what made computers so irresistible in the first place.

              <br><br>
              I have no idea how to fix it. I'm hoping you'll tell me how to fix it. But we should do something to fix it. We can try a hundred different things. You people are designers; treat it as a design problem! How do we change this industry to make it wonderful again? How do we build an Internet we're not <span class="rollover bg70">ashamed of</span>?

              <br><br>
              Thank you for your kind attention today. I hope you had a wonderful conference.
