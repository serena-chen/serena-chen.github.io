		08 Drift. Allow yourself to wander aimlessly.
		09 Begin anywhere.
		10 Everyone is a leader. Growth happens.
		11 Harvest ideas.
		12 Keep moving.
		13 Slow down.
		14 Don’t be cool. Cool is conservative fear dressed in black.
		15 Ask stupid questions. Growth is fuelled by desire and innocence.
		16 Collaborate.
